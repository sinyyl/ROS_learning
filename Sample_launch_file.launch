In the launch file, you have some extra tags for setting parameters and remaps. For now, don't worry about those tags and focus on the node tag.
All launch files are contained within a <launch> tag. Inside that tag, you can see a <node> tag, where we specify the following parameters:
	1.	pkg="package_name" # Name of the package that contains the code of the ROS program to execute
	2.	type="python_file_name.py"# Name of the program file that we want to execute
	3.	name="node_name" # Name of the ROS node that will launch our Python file
	4.	output="type_of_output"# Through which channel you will print the output of the Python file
